"# timesheet_pto" 

Created timesheetApp: user can select date for timesheet, pull the week and enter the timesheet work and pto hours. 
Click to review the timesheet and click submit to post to Model. Currently only posting userID and wkhrs. Need to redo model schema and reformat timesheet dates for postng.

Has user registration and login/logout implemented.

Stuck at needing to use javascript for situation where user wants to edit their timesheet.
